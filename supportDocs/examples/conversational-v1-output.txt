🔸 Query 4: My cake collapsed in the middle. What went wrong?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Here are some steps to take when the cake is collapsing:

1. Remove the pan from the oven and remove any excess


🔸 Query 5: How do I know when pasta is done?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: When pasta is done, it should be firm and have a nice crust. The edges of the pasta should be slightly browned, but not too brown.

The pasta should be cooked for at least 3 minutes or until it is completely cooked through. If it is not cooked through, it is done.

To check if pasta is done, open the pasta and put it in a bowl. Take a small spoonful of pasta and gently push it into the bowl. If the pasta is cooked through, it is done.

If the pasta is still soft and not firm, the pasta is ready for use. You can add additional water or pasta to thin it out, but don't overdo it.

After the pasta is cooked, you can remove the bowl from the pasta and place it on a cutting board. You can also use a fork to break apart the pasta into smaller pieces. You can also use a spoon to stir the pasta into the sauce.

When the pasta is done, you can use it as a main course, or add a few pieces of fruit, nuts, or cheese to top the pasta.
